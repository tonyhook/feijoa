# Feijoa — An AI-Native Application Built from Scratch

Feijoa is a ground-up implementation of an AI-native application,
featuring a deterministic Kernel, an Orchestrator layer, and multiple Agents.

The goal is to explore how to build controllable, extensible agent systems
with first-class software architecture.
